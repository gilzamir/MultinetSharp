Introduction
============

**MultinetSharp** is the result of my research on neural evolution applied to games. For now, I have a simple implementation with poor results. Let's say the current version is something like "pre-release". Soon I will be posting more information on this process and showing some auxiliary projects demonstrating the developed functionality. If you want additional information, please contact me: gilzamir@gmail.com.
